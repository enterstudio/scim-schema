This repository contains the SCIM schema.

The current version can be found at http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|osiam.

The SCIM schema provides a User and a Group Object which are used to exchange
data with [OSIAM](https://github.com/osiam/osiam). It is also used by the
[connector4java](https://github.com/osiam/connector4java) that gives you an easy
way to interact with OSIAM, if you are using Java.

For more information and documentation please take a look in the
[docs](docs/README.md).
